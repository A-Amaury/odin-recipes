    <p>
      Big, soft, gingerbread cookies made with molasses, ginger, and other spices are a holiday favorite. 
      This gingerbread cookie recipe for ginger cookies rolled in sugar is my oldest son's favorite. 
      Store cooled cookies in an airtight container and they will stay soft for days.

      <li>Use floured hands to shape dough into 24 walnut-sized balls. 
        Roll each ball in the reserved sugar until coated. 
        Place cookies 2 inches apart onto ungreased cookie sheets, 
        and flatten slightly with the bottom of a glass. </li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes, switching racks halfway through. </li>
      <li> Remove from the oven and allow cookies to cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes, 
        then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. </li>
      <li>Eat it!</li>
