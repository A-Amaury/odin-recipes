    <p>
      Hershey's chocolate cake is incredibly indulgent, yet incredibly easy to make with basic ingredients.
      The original one, which was made with six candy bars, was developed post-World War II. 
      Americans loved the recipe because it celebrated the end of food shortages and, thus, the end of the war years.
